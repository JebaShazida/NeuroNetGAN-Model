# NeuroNetGAN-Model
NeuroNetGAN is a hybrid model that integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for augmenting data, Residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting feature, and Random Forest (RF) classification to ensure robust classification for human facial emotion recognition.
